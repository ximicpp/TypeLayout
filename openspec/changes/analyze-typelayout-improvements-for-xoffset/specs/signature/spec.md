## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Improvement Roadmap for XOffset Integration
TypeLayout SHALL maintain an analyzed improvement roadmap based on real-world
integration feedback from XOffsetDatastructure. Each improvement candidate
MUST be evaluated against the principle that TypeLayout remains a generic
type-signature library with no domain-specific knowledge.

#### Scenario: Analysis identifies actionable improvements
- **WHEN** a systematic gap analysis is performed against the primary consumer
- **THEN** the result is a prioritized list of improvements with effort estimates
  and clear accept/reject rationale
