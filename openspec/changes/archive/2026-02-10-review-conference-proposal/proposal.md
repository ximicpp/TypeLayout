# Change: Review and analyze the conference proposal

## Why
CONFERENCE_PROPOSAL.md is a critical outward-facing document for CppCon/ACCU/C++Now
submission. It needs a thorough review for factual accuracy against the codebase,
internal consistency with the paper sections and README, and persuasiveness.

## What Changes
Review only — no code changes. Produce a findings report as `tasks.md` annotations.
If issues are found, fix them in CONFERENCE_PROPOSAL.md directly.

## Impact
- Affected specs: documentation
- Affected code: CONFERENCE_PROPOSAL.md (text corrections only)
