# Change: Analyze two-layer signature system functionality and principles

## Why
A comprehensive technical document is needed to explain the two-layer signature system's
design rationale, operating principles, and practical use cases with real examples.
This serves as both internal documentation and external communication material.

## What Changes
- Analysis-only proposal: produces a design.md document explaining the system
- No code changes

## Impact
- Affected specs: signature (documentation enrichment, no requirement changes)
