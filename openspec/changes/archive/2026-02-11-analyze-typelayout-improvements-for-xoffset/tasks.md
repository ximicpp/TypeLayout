## 1. Current Integration Inventory
- [x] 1.1 Catalog all TypeLayout APIs used by XOffsetDatastructure
- [x] 1.2 Catalog all TypeLayout APIs NOT used but potentially relevant
- [x] 1.3 Catalog XOffsetDatastructure features that overlap with or duplicate TypeLayout

## 2. Gap Analysis
- [x] 2.1 Analyze opaque registration ergonomics and completeness
- [x] 2.2 Analyze compile-time safety API boundary
- [x] 2.3 Analyze signature format stability and versioning
- [x] 2.4 Analyze tools layer utilization gaps
- [x] 2.5 Analyze constexpr step limit impact on real-world usage
- [x] 2.6 Analyze FixedString limitations for large types

## 3. Improvement Candidates
- [x] 3.1 Evaluate each candidate against "TypeLayout stays generic" principle
- [x] 3.2 Assign priority (P0-P3) and estimated effort
- [x] 3.3 Identify which improvements benefit TypeLayout independently vs only for XOffset

## 4. Deliverable
- [x] 4.1 Produce prioritized improvement roadmap
