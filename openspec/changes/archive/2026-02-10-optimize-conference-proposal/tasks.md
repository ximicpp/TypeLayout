## 1. Analysis — Diagnose Problems
- [x] 1.1 Complete a point-by-point analysis of CONFERENCE_PROPOSAL.md
- [x] 1.2 Cross-check claims against paper formal results (§4) and evaluation (§6)
- [x] 1.3 Apply anonymous-review scoring rubric to identify weak areas

## 2. Optimization — Apply Fixes
- [x] 2.1 Tighten Abstract (remove code examples, use pure text, increase information density)
- [x] 2.2 Fix factual errors (F1: memcmp→memcpy, F2: Strict Refinement precision, F3: remove "V3", F4: semi-formal proofs)
- [x] 2.3 Add 30-minute condensed version as alternative
- [x] 2.4 Strengthen "Why This Talk Matters" — replace Boost mention with reproducibility argument + add attendee takeaways
- [x] 2.5 Add missing technical precision (Projection Theorem + Strictness combined, denotational semantics naming)
- [x] 2.6 Anonymize Supplementary Materials (remove GitHub link, add "available upon acceptance"), delete Speaker Bio

## 3. Validation
- [x] 3.1 Re-evaluate acceptance probability after optimizations → estimated 72-82% (up from 65-75%)
