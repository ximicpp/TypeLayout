Intermediate to Advanced

## Abstract

This talk is a P2996 experience report: what happens when you build a
non-trivial consteval library on C++26 static reflection — and what
you learn about the API surface, its limits, and cross-compiler
behavior along the way.

The driving question is practical: *which of my types can I safely
memcpy between which build targets without serialization?* Standard
C++ alone cannot answer this portably at compile time. `sizeof` misses
field offsets. `offsetof` is conditionally-supported on
non-standard-layout types (private members, inheritance) and
completely inapplicable to bit-fields. Manual assertions are
platform-local and cannot compare across compilers.

The running case study is TypeLayout, a layout-signature library that
uses a small set of reflection primitives to generate a compile-time
**layout signature** — a deterministic string encoding every field offset, size,
alignment, and padding gap of any C++ type, including classes with
private members, inheritance hierarchies, and bit-fields. Export
signatures where you have a P2996 compiler, verify compatibility
anywhere with plain C++17 — and get a definitive answer for every
type-target pair: transfer-safe, layout mismatch, or pointer risk.

The talk opens with the compatibility matrix, then drills into *why*
each result is what it is — teaching reusable reflection patterns,
consteval techniques, and safety classification through the results the
matrix reveals. Attendees leave with concrete P2996 experience,
reusable consteval patterns, and an open-source reference
implementation (200+ `static_assert` checks across 17 type categories,
from primitives and records through pointers and opaque containers).

## Outline

### Part 1 — The Question and the Answer (8 min)

*"Six types, six targets. Which can I memcpy without serialization?"*

- Introduce six demo types (four top-level message types plus two
  building blocks — `Timestamp` and `MessageHeader` — that appear
  flattened inside the others). Not trivial standard-layout structs, but
  real C++ code where `offsetof` is conditionally-supported or
  inapplicable:
  ```cpp
  class Timestamp {                          // private members
      int64_t seconds_; uint32_t nanos_;
  };
  class MessageHeader {                      // base class
      uint32_t magic_; uint16_t version_; uint16_t type_;
  };
  class TelemetryMsg : public MessageHeader { // inheritance + bit-fields
      Timestamp ts_; float values_[4];
      uint8_t quality_ : 4; uint8_t flags_ : 4;
  };
  class PlatformRiskyMsg : public MessageHeader { // platform-variant
      Timestamp ts_;
      long counter_;    // LP64: 8B, LLP64: 4B
      wchar_t label_[8]; // Linux/macOS: 4B, Windows: 2B
  };
  class EventRef : public MessageHeader {    // pointer member
      Timestamp ts_; EventRef* next_;
  };
  class BufferedReadings : public MessageHeader { // opaque container
      uint32_t sensor_id_;
      XVector<float> samples_; // offset_ptr-based, registered opaque
  };
  ```
- Six build targets spanning two data models and three compilers:
  ```
  x86_64_linux_gcc         LP64   long=8  wchar=4  ldbl=16
  x86_64_linux_clang       LP64   long=8  wchar=4  ldbl=16
  arm64_linux_gcc           LP64   long=8  wchar=4  ldbl=16(!)  # fld128, not fld80
  arm64_macos_clang         LP64   long=8  wchar=4  ldbl=8
  x86_64_windows_msvc       LLP64  long=4  wchar=2  ldbl=8
  x86_64_windows_clangcl    LLP64  long=4  wchar=2  ldbl=8
  ```
- Open with the compatibility matrix — the answer first, explanation
  later:
  ```
  Build targets: 6     ABI equivalence: {x86_linux_gcc, x86_linux_clang, arm64_linux_gcc}
                                         {win_msvc, win_clangcl}

  Type              x86_linux  arm_linux  macOS   Windows   Safety
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  TelemetryMsg        MATCH      MATCH    MATCH    MATCH     Safe
  PlatformRiskyMsg    MATCH      MATCH    MATCH    DIFFER    Safe
  EventRef            MATCH      MATCH    MATCH    MATCH     Pointer!
  BufferedReadings    MATCH      MATCH    MATCH    MATCH     Opaque

  x86_linux covers both gcc and clang (ABI-equivalent).
  Building blocks (Timestamp, MessageHeader) are flattened into messages.

  Safety describes the type, not the transfer verdict:
    Safe = byte-copy safe (no pointers, no opaque)
    Pointer! = contains pointer (memcpy produces dangling ref)
    Opaque = contains opaque type (user-declared safety)
  Combine Safety with MATCH/DIFFER for the transfer decision.

  [DIFFER] PlatformRiskyMsg:
    linux_gcc:    ...@24:i64[s:8,a:8],@32:array[s:32,a:4]<wchar[s:4,a:4],8>...
    windows_msvc: ...@24:i32[s:4,a:4],@28:array[s:16,a:2]<wchar[s:2,a:2],8>...
                       ^^^                  ^^^
  ```
- The audience sees patterns immediately:
  - `linux_gcc == linux_clang` — same ABI, verified by signatures.
  - `TelemetryMsg` is safe everywhere — inheritance + bit-fields +
    private members, but all fixed-width at the leaf level.
  - `PlatformRiskyMsg` breaks on Windows — `long` and `wchar_t`.
  - `EventRef` matches everywhere but is flagged `Pointer!` — dangling.
  - `BufferedReadings` is `Opaque` — requires user trust.
- Contrast with the status quo: "How would you verify this today?"
  Existing tools each cover part of the problem — `pahole` dumps
  layouts but requires post-build diffing; `offsetof` is compile-time
  but conditionally-supported on non-standard-layout types and
  inapplicable to bit-fields. None provides compile-time,
  cross-platform, bit-field-aware verification in one step.
  With TypeLayout, a single `static_assert` comparing two layout
  signatures replaces per-field, per-platform manual assertions.

**Takeaway**: The compatibility matrix gives you a definitive,
per-type-per-target answer. The rest of the talk explains how it's
built and what each column means.

*The matrix gives us the answer. Now let's learn to read the evidence
behind it.*

### Part 2 — What the Signatures Tell You (12 min)

*"Reading the diff."*

- Drill into `TelemetryMsg`'s signature to teach the format:
  ```
  [64-le]record[s:48,a:8]{
    @0:u32[s:4,a:4],               // magic_    (from MessageHeader)
    @4:u16[s:2,a:2],               // version_
    @6:u16[s:2,a:2],               // type_
    @8:i64[s:8,a:8],               // ts_.seconds_  (flattened!)
    @16:u32[s:4,a:4],              // ts_.nanos_
    @24:array[s:16,a:4]<f32[s:4,a:4],4>,  // values_[4]
    @40.0:bits<4,u8[s:1,a:1]>,    // quality_ : 4
    @40.4:bits<4,u8[s:1,a:1]>     // flags_ : 4
  }
  ```
  Key observations for the audience:
  - Base class fields are flattened — `magic_` is at `@0`, not nested
    inside a sub-record. Inheritance is erased; only byte identity
    remains.
  - `Timestamp` is flattened too — `seconds_` appears at `@8` because
    that's where it actually lives in `TelemetryMsg`'s layout.
  - Bit-fields have bit-level offsets: `@40.0` and `@40.4`.
  - **Private members are visible.** `access_context::unchecked()` is
    why this works — and why `offsetof` cannot compete.
- Drill into the `PlatformRiskyMsg` diff: same source, different
  signatures. Show the character-level divergence annotation and how
  `i64` vs `i32` (long) and `wchar[s:4]` vs `wchar[s:2]` tell you
  exactly which field broke.
- The gotcha: two types can have the same `sizeof` but different field
  offsets. Concrete example: `Timestamp` has `sizeof == 16` but only
  12 bytes of data (seconds_ + nanos_) — 4 bytes of tail padding are
  included in `sizeof` but invisible in the source code. This is why `TelemetryMsg::values_` starts
  at offset 24, not 20. The signature catches it; `sizeof` doesn't.

**Takeaway**: Signatures are human-readable diffs. When they fail, you
can see exactly which field diverged and why — no debugger, no core
dump, no printf.

*We can now read signatures — but how are they generated at compile
time? That's where P2996 static reflection comes in.*

### Part 3 — How Reflection Builds Signatures (15 min, dense)

*"Reflection patterns for layout analysis."*

- The P2996 primitives central to signature generation:
  ```
  ^^T                              — reflect a type
  [:type_of(member):]              — splice back to a type
  nonstatic_data_members_of(^^T, access_context::unchecked())
  bases_of(^^T, access_context::unchecked())
  type_of(member)
  size_of(type)                    — size in bytes (reflection version of sizeof)
  offset_of(member)                — returns {.bytes, .bits}
  is_bit_field(member)
  bit_size_of(member)
  ```
- Code walkthrough: `TypeSignature<T>::calculate()` — recursive
  consteval traversal of fields and bases. Show the actual
  `layout_field_with_comma` function and how compile-time indexing
  replaces runtime iteration. Introduce each primitive in context
  rather than as an isolated list.
- Why `offset_of` is the key enabler: it returns the *compiler's own*
  layout decision — authoritative by definition. Unlike `offsetof`
  (conditionally-supported on non-standard-layout types, inapplicable
  to bit-fields), it works on every type the compiler can lay out.
- Why `access_context::unchecked()` is essential: layout verification
  must see private members. Without it, the library cannot handle
  `TelemetryMsg` — and most real types have private members.
- Show that the core pattern works **without a library** — a minimal
  consteval layout check in ~10 lines of raw P2996:
  ```cpp
  // Simplified: does not recurse into bases or nested structs.
  template <typename T, typename U>
  consteval bool layout_matches() {
      constexpr auto a = nonstatic_data_members_of(^^T, access_context::unchecked());
      constexpr auto b = nonstatic_data_members_of(^^U, access_context::unchecked());
      if (a.size() != b.size()) return false;
      for (size_t i = 0; i < a.size(); ++i)
          if (offset_of(a[i]) != offset_of(b[i])
              || size_of(type_of(a[i])) != size_of(type_of(b[i])))
              return false;
      return sizeof(T) == sizeof(U);
  }
  ```
  This is the kernel of the idea. TypeLayout adds flattening,
  bit-field handling, opaque registration, and cross-platform export
  on top — but the audience can reuse the pattern independently.
- Friction points (honest report):
  - Constexpr step limits on large types (>50 fields need
    `-fconstexpr-steps`).
  - Bit-field allocation differs across compilers — `offset_of`
    faithfully reports each compiler's decision, correctly detecting
    cross-compiler incompatibility.
  - Expansion statements (P1306) would simplify the recursion;
    virtual inheritance is rejected at compile time.

**Takeaway**: The core pattern fits in ~10 lines of raw P2996 —
reusable without any library. The main friction (constexpr step
limits, missing expansion statements) is a tooling gap, not an API
deficiency.

*We have signatures, and we know how they're generated. But look back
at the matrix — `EventRef` is all MATCH, yet flagged `Pointer!`.
Layout match is necessary, but is it sufficient?*

### Part 4 — Beyond Layout Match: Transport Safety (13 min)

*"Matching layout is necessary but not sufficient."*

- Return to the matrix — two rows that need explaining:
  - `EventRef`: all MATCH, but `Pointer!`. Why?
  - `BufferedReadings`: all MATCH, but `Opaque`. Why?
- **Byte-copy safety** (`is_byte_copy_safe_v<T>`):
  - Recursive compile-time check: T and every member/base must be
    trivially copyable and must not contain pointers.
  - `EventRef` fails: `next_` is a pointer — copying bytes produces
    a dangling pointer in the receiver's address space.
  - Formula: **signature match + byte-copy safe = safe to memcpy.**
- **Opaque types** — the `BufferedReadings` story:
  - Some types (offset_ptr containers, platform handles) are not
    fully analyzable by reflection. Register them as opaque with a
    one-line macro that declares safety properties and a tag.
    The signature encodes tag, size, alignment, and element type.
    Safety recurses into the element type.
- **Runtime transfer verification** — the plugin `dlopen` pattern:
  a plugin exports its signature as a C string; the host calls
  `is_transfer_safe<T>(plugin_sig)` at load time. One call checks
  two conditions: byte-copy safe + signature match — the definition
  of *transfer-safe* from Part 1's matrix.

**Takeaway**: Layout match tells you the bytes line up. Byte-copy
safety tells you whether copying those bytes is meaningful. Together
they answer: "can I memcpy this class to that endpoint?"

### Part 5 — The Cross-Platform Pipeline (7 min)

*"Export once, compare anywhere."*

- Two-phase workflow:
  - **Phase 1** (on each build target): a one-line macro exports
    compile-time signatures + ABI metadata to a header file.
  - **Phase 2** (on any machine, C++17 only): include the exported
    headers and run a compatibility check that produces the matrix
    from Part 1. Phase 2 does not require P2996 — export where you
    have the compiler, verify anywhere.
- ABI equivalence grouping: build targets with identical fingerprints
  (pointer size, sizeof(long), sizeof(wchar_t), sizeof(long double),
  max alignment, arch prefix encoding endianness) are grouped
  automatically. Same-ABI build targets are *likely* but not
  *guaranteed* to match — for example, arm64 uses fld128 for
  `long double` vs x86_64's fld80, so types containing `long double`
  DIFFER despite sharing an ABI group. The signature comparison is
  definitive.

**Takeaway**: You don't need P2996 on every machine. Export where you
have the compiler, verify anywhere.

### Q&A (5 min)

## Non-Goals

This talk does not cover serialization frameworks (Protobuf,
FlatBuffers, Cap'n Proto), ABI stability guarantees, dynamic or
polymorphic type transport, or automatic remediation of layout
mismatches. The scope is *detection and verification*, not correction.
IDL-based serialization and layout signatures are complementary:
serialization eliminates layout dependence entirely; layout signatures
verify that you can safely skip serialization for a given type-target
pair.

## Key Takeaways

1. The real question is *"which types can I zero-copy between which
   build targets?"* — and before P2996, standard C++ alone could not
   answer this portably at compile time for classes with private
   members, inheritance, or bit-fields.
2. `offsetof` is conditionally-supported on non-standard-layout types
   and inapplicable to bit-fields. P2996's `offset_of` works on any
   type the compiler can lay out.
3. Nine P2996 reflection features form a functionally complete
   toolkit for layout analysis. The core pattern fits in ~10 lines
   and is reusable without any library.
4. Layout match alone is not enough. Byte-copy safety (no pointers,
   no non-relocatable opaque) completes the transport decision.
5. Export signatures where you have a P2996 compiler, compare them
   anywhere with C++17. Cross-compiler, cross-OS, cross-architecture.

## Target Audience

- **Primary**: C++ developers working with IPC, shared memory, network
  protocols, plugin systems, or binary file formats — anyone who has
  written `static_assert(sizeof(T) == N)` or wished `offsetof` worked
  on their real types.
- **Secondary**: Library authors exploring P2996 reflection as a
  building block for compile-time analysis.
- **Tertiary**: Compiler implementers and language designers interested
  in real-world P2996 implementation experience — especially
  `offset_of` on bit-fields and `access_context::unchecked()` across
  compilers.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with `sizeof`, `alignof`, `offsetof`
- Basic understanding of memory layout (padding, alignment)
- No prior P2996 or reflection knowledge required — explained in talk

## Why This Talk Matters

**P2996 is standardized, not theoretical.** The reflection API
(`offset_of`, `nonstatic_data_members_of`, `type_of`,
`access_context`) was voted into the C++26 working draft at the Sofia
meeting (June 2025). Bloomberg's Clang fork provides a
production-quality implementation today. Yet most public examples
remain toy demos (enum-to-string, JSON serialization sketches). This
talk presents a non-trivial consteval system — 12 tests across 17
type categories with extensive compile-time validation — that
stress-tests the API surface and reports what works, what's awkward, and what needs tooling
investment. It shows what reflection enables for **systems
programming**, not just metaprogramming convenience.

**Addresses a real problem.** Every team that ships binary data across
process boundaries has hit layout mismatch bugs — silent data
corruption that surfaces only in production, on a different platform.
The standard toolkit (`sizeof`/`offsetof`) fails on types with private
members, inheritance, or bit-fields and provides no cross-platform story.
The case study shows how P2996 replaces ad-hoc assertions with a
systematic, compiler-verified answer.

**Honest experience report.** This is not a sales pitch — the talk
includes a raw-P2996 version of the core pattern so attendees can
reuse the technique without any library. It reports what works well
(`offset_of`, `access_context`, `is_bit_field`), what's awkward
(index-based recursion without expansion statements), and what's a
real barrier (constexpr step limits). It also reports cross-compiler
differences (bit-field allocation strategies, `long double`
representation) that P2996 faithfully captures but cannot resolve.
This data is directly actionable: compiler teams and SG7 benefit from
systematic feedback on how reflection behaves across implementations.

**Immediately reproducible.** The case-study library is header-only,
open-source (Boost Software License), with no external dependencies. Attendees
can reproduce every example using the Bloomberg Clang P2996 fork today,
and the code will work unchanged when mainstream C++26 compilers ship.
